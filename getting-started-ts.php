					<h1>Getting Started</h1>

					<p>We've two brand new tutorials on using Phaser with TypeScript available.</p>

					<p>Part 1 is <a href="http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser/how-to-use-phaser-with-typescript">How to use Phaser with TypeScript</a>. In it covers, step-by-step, how to set up Visual Studio for development with Phaser, and walks you through building your first simple project.</p>

					<p>In Part 2 we cover <a href="http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser/advanced-phaser-and-typescript-projects">Advanced TypeScript Phaser Projects</a>. In this tutorial we focus on building a properly structured game, using a defined module, classes that extend core Phaser objects and build a solid template you can use for future games.</p>

			        <h2>The Phaser Examples</h2>

			        <p>Phaser comes with a comprehensive suite of examples. At the current count over 160 of them. They are short self-contained snippets of code that focus on just a couple of elements and nothing more, and as such they're really useful to learn from! Whenever we add a new feature into Phaser we create an example to demonstrate how to use it, so there are all kinds of examples from simple things like loading audio to sprite animation and input handling.</p>

			        <p>Although we've uploaded the Examples to our site we still recommend that you copy the whole phaser folder (the entire repository) to your webroot, so you can easily run the Examples locally. If you've copied the phaser folder into your webroot then you can access the examples at:</p>

			        <code>http://localhost/phaser/examples</code>

			        <p>Note: The URL above will differ based on your server set-up.</p>

			        <h3>Side by side</h3>

			        <p>There are two ways to explore the examples. The default view is a big long list and each new example opens in a new page. There is also a 'Side View', a link to which you'll find at the top of the page. This puts all of the examples in a list down the left and the content and code loads into a frame on the right. Each one has its advantages, so play around and explore!</p>

			        <h2>Next Steps</h2>

			        <p>Your game development experience with Phaser begins here! Although we've only touched upon the basics you still have a fully working development environment, access to the API docs and hundreds of examples. Even so it's always best to code as part of a community - and for that we cannot recommend our forum enough. It has gone from strength to strength over the past few months, and you're sure to find help and support when you need it most.</p>

			        <p>Bounce ideas of others, hang-out in the chat room, browse the games showcase and just be involved!</p>

			        <h3>Phaser Newsletter</h3>

			        <p>We publish a monthly Phaser newsletter. As well as details about new releases it also contains short tutorials and features. Sign-up for free to have it hit your inbox during the first week of the month.</p>

			        <h3>Contribute</h3>

			        <p>You can help shape the way in which Phaser grows. If you find a bug, please report it. It won't take you long, and to date we have fixed over 91% of all reported issues (and we're still working on the other 9%). You can also issue Pull Requests against the development branch, or release your own plugins or filters.</p>

			        <h3>Show us your games!</h3>

			        <p>We spend many tireless hours working on Phaser because we want it to be the best HTML5 game development framework it can possibly be. We understand it won't be perfect for everyone, and we're cool with that. But if you use it and make something, no matter how small you think that is, please do let us know. You won't believe with a real motivational boost it is when devs show us the games they've been working on! Reach out to us either on the forum, via twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/photonstorm">@photonstorm</a>) or by <a href="mailto:rdavey@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>

			        <p>Most of all though, we truly hope you have fun making your game.</p>
